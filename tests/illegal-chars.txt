To create images, graphic artists rely on their perceptual experience. Seeking to explain perception, visual scientists begin by measuring it. By comparing how the same topic, legibility, is treated by our two disciplines, this case study isolates the effect of the discipline from that of the topic itself. The dialog surprisingly reveals two big differences in approach and one common discovery. For the scientist, legibility is reading speed; for the artist, it is pleasure (or avoiding displeasure), a subjective amalgam of factors that make the text fit for consumption. Reading pleasure is much more sensitive to the typography than is reading speed. Scientists measure perception but don’t really look (i.e. pause to appreciate the pleasure); artists look but don’
